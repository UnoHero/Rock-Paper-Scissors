                Objective:
                <br>
                The objective of the game is to win the best of 3 rounds against the computer opponent. 
                <br><br>
                Moves:
                <br>
                The player can choose one of three moves: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
                The computer opponent will also choose one of the three moves.
                You can also use the coresponding key on your keyboard to play: 
                <br>(1) = Rock -- (2) = Paper -- (3) = Scissors
                <br><br>
                Rules for Determining Round Winner:
                <br>
                Rock beats Scissors.
                Scissors beats Paper.
                Paper beats Rock.
                <br><br>
                Gameplay:
                <br>
                The player and the computer both select their moves simultaneously.
                The winner of each round is determined based on the rules mentioned above.
                If the player's move defeats the computer's move, the player wins the round.
                If the computer's move defeats the player's move, the computer wins the round.
                If both the player and the computer choose the same move, the round is a tie and no one gets a pint.
                <br><br>

                <br>
